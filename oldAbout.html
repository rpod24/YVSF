                        outside school as well as giving back to the community. During his sophomore year, he created a
                        machine learning algorithm to detect insobriety based on an individualâ€™s walking pattern as
                        measured by their smartphone's gyroscope. The main objective of the program was to prevent drunk
                        driving through audiovisual warnings on smartphones and potential disablement of automobiles. He
                        founded YVSF along with a team of motivated high schoolers working on spreading awareness to
                        fellow teens and eradicating the scourge of drunk driving.
